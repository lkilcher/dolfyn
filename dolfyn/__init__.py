"""
This is the Doppler Oceanography Library for pYthoN (DOLfYN). It is
designed to read and work with oceanographyic velocity measurements
from Acoustic Doppler Profilers (ADPs) and Acoustic Doppler
Velocimeters (ADVs). It is a high-level object-oriented library
composed of a set of **data-object** classes (types) that contain data
from a particular measurement instrument, and a collection of
**functions** that manipulate those data objects to accomplish data
processing and data analysis tasks.

Data Types
==========

The data types in the DOLfYN library are:

{object_table}

Functions
=========

The functions for working with and operating on these data types are:

{func_table}
