    Parameters
    ----------

    advo : dolfyn.adv.adv class

    accel_filtfreq : float
      the frequency at which to high-pass filter the acceleration
      signal to remove low-frequency drift.

      a second frequency to high-pass filter the integrated

    to_earth : bool (optional, default: True)
      All variables in the advo.props['rotate_vars'] list will be
      rotated into either the earth frame (to_earth=True) or the
      instrument frame (to_earth=False).

    separate_probes : bool (optional, default: False)
      a flag to perform motion-correction at the probe tips, and
      perform motion correction in beam-coordinates, then transform
      back into XYZ/earth coordinates. This correction seems to be
      lower than the noise levels of the ADV, so the defualt is to not
      use it (False).

    Returns
    -------
    This function returns None, it operates on the input data object,
    ``advo``. The following attributes are added to `advo`:

      ``velraw`` is the uncorrected velocity

      ``velrot`` is the rotational component of the head motion (from
                 AngRt)

      ``velacc`` is the translational component of the head motion (from
                 Accel)

      ``AccelStable`` is the low-pass filtered Accel signal

    The primary velocity vector attribute, ``vel``, is motion corrected
    such that:

          vel = velraw + velrot + velacc

    The signs are correct in this equation. The measured velocity
    induced by head-motion is *in the opposite direction* of the head
    motion.  i.e. when the head moves one way in stationary flow, it
    measures a velocity in the opposite direction. Therefore, to
    remove the motion from the raw signal we *add* the head motion.

    Notes
    -----

    Acceleration signals from inertial sensors are notorious for
    having a small bias that can drift slowly in time. When
    integrating these signals to estimate velocity the bias is
    amplified and leads to large errors in the estimated
    velocity. There are two methods for removing these errors,

    1) high-pass filter the acceleration signal prior and/or after
       integrating. This implicitly assumes that the low-frequency
       translational velocity is zero.
    2) provide a slowly-varying reference position (often from a GPS)
       to an IMU that can use the signal (usually using Kalman
       filters) to debias the acceleration signal.

    Because method (1) removes `real` low-frequency acceleration,
    method (2) is more accurate. However, providing reference position
    estimates to undersea instruments is practically challenging and
    expensive. Therefore, lacking the ability to use method (2), this
    function utilizes method (1).

    For deployments in which the ADV is mounted on a mooring, or other
    semi-fixed structure, the assumption of zero low-frequency
    translational velocity is a reasonable one. However, for
    deployments on ships, gliders, or other moving objects it is
    not. The measured velocity, after motion-correction, will still
    hold some of this contamination and will be a sum of the ADV
    motion and the measured velocity on long time scales.  If
    low-frequency motion is known separate from the ADV (e.g. from a
    bottom-tracking ADP, or from a ship's GPS), it may be possible to
    remove that signal from the ADV signal in post-processing. The
    accuracy of this approach has not, to my knowledge, been tested
    yet.

        Perform motion correction on an IMU-equipped ADV object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        advo : :class:`ADVraw <base.ADVraw>`
          The adv object on which to perform motion correction.
          It must contain the following data attributes:

          - vel : The velocity array.
          - Accel : The translational acceleration array.
          - AngRt : The rotation-rate array.
          - orientmat : The orientation matrix.
          - props : a dictionary that has 'body2head_vec',
            'body2head_rotmat' and 'coord_sys'.

        to_earth : bool (optional, default: True)
          A boolean that specifies whether the data should be
          rotated into the earth frame.

        Notes
        -----

        After calling this function, `advo` will have *velrot* and
        *velacc* data attributes. The velocity vector attribute ``vel``
        will be motion corrected according to:

            u_corr = u_raw + velacc + velrot

        Therefore, to recover the 'raw' velocity, subtract velacc and
        velrot from ``vel``.

        This method does not return a data object, it operates on
        (motion corrects) the input `advo`.
