## Version 0.11.0
	- Use dat.set_declination() to set the declination
	- new defs for heading, pitch, roll (+docs)
		- new order of euler2orient inputs (h,p,r)
		- dropped heading, pitch, roll from data; unless user specifies
		keep_orient_raw=True in `dolfyn.read`, in which case the data is
		stored in orient.raw
	- New definitions/tools for 'principal coordinate system'
		- switched from using principal_angle to principal_heading
		- removed `calc_principal_angle` method
		- added `calc_principal_heading` function
		- principal rotations only from earth
	- ad2cp earth2principal rotations now supported

## Version 0.10.1
	- Add the `.shortcuts` property
	- Read userdata.json files for ADPs
	- Account for declination in ADP data processing
	- Add function for calculating orientation matrix of RDI ADPs
	- Support motion-correction of ADV data in non-inst frames

## Version 0.10.0
	- Major reorg
	- Switch to Apache 2.0 License

## Version 0.9.0

- The package is now py3 compatible
- Add continuous integration on Appveyor, Travis-ci, codecov
- Added a universal 'read' function.
