Name,Description/Notes
fs*, This is the sample rate of the instrument [Hz]
coord_sys*, "The coordinate system of the data object. When a data object is rotated to a new coordinate system using the ``dat.rotate2()`` method, the value of ``dat.props['coord_sys']`` is updated to reflect the final coordinate system. Valid values are: **beam**, **inst**, **earth**, and **principal**. For further details on these coordinate systems see the :ref:`rotations` section."
rotate_vars*,The variables in the data object that should be rotated when rotating the data object.
declination*,"The magnetic declination where the measurements were made (in degrees that magnetic North is right of True North). Set this value using ``dat.set_declination(<value>)``."
declination_in_heading*,"A boolean specifying whether the heading includes the declination. If this is True, then the earth coordinate system is True (i.e., v is velocity toward True North)."
declination_in_orientmat*,"A boolean specifying whether the ``orient.orientmat`` includes the declination. If this is True, then the earth coordinate system is True (i.e., v is velocity toward True North)."
principal_angle,"The horizontal angle between the earth coordinate system (or whatever `coord_sys_principal_ref` is) and the *principal axes* of the flow (u: streamwise, v: cross-stream, w: up). [radians, positive means principal axis is clockwise from earth]."
coord_sys_principal_ref*, "The reference frame in which principal_angle was calculated."
has imu*, A boolean indicating whether the instrument has an inertial motion sensor/unit.
inst_make*, The manufacturer name.
inst_model*, The instrument model.
DutyCycle_NBurst*, The number of pings in a burst.
DutyCycle_NCycle*, "The time -- in number of pings -- before the next burst starts. (this may be incorrect for some instrument types, please :repo:`report issues <issues/>`)"
body2head_vec, "The vector from the center of the ADV body reference frame to the center of the head's reference frame, *in coordinates of the body reference frame*. For ADPs this is always zero because the two coordinate systems are centered at the same place."
body2head_rotmat, "The rotation matrix that rotates vectors from the instrument body reference-frame to the head reference-frame. For ADPs this is always the identity matrix. Valid values are: 3-by-3 valid rotation matrices, or: ``'eye'``, ``'identity'``, or ``1`` all of which specify that it is the identity matrix. This is typically used for cable-head ADVs where the ADV head is not oriented the same as the ADV body."
motion accel_filtfreq Hz, "The filter-frequency for the computing translational motion from the acceleration signal of an IMU. This is only used for motion correction. This high-pass filter is applied prior to integrating acceleration. This value is only used if when ``accel_filtfreq`` is not explicitly specified when motion-correcting"
motion vel_filtfreq Hz, "The filter-frequency for the computing translational motion from the acceleration signal of an IMU. This is only used for motion correction. This high-pass filter is applied after integrating acceleration. This value is only used if when ``vel_filtfreq`` is not explicitly specified when motion-correcting."
lonlat\ |dagger|, "The location of the measurements in decimal degrees. Longitude is positive west of the prime-meridian, and latitude is positive North of the equator."
