Motion Correcting ADV-IMU measurements
--------------------------------------

The Nortek Vector ADV can be purchased with an Inertial Motion Unit
(IMU) that measures the ADV motion. These measurements can be used to
remove motion from ADV velocity measurements when the ADV is mounted
on a moving platform (e.g. a mooring). This approach has been found to
be effective for removing high-frequency motion from ADV measurements,
but cannot remove low-frequency (:math:`\lesssim` 0.03Hz) motion
because of bias-drift inherent in IMU accelerometer sensors that
contaminates motion estimates at those frequencies.

This documentation is designed to document the methods for performing
motion correction of ADV-IMU measurements. The accuracy and
applicability of these measurements is beyond the scope of this
documentation (journal articles are forthcoming).

Pre-Deployment Requirements
...........................

In order to perform motion correction the ADV-IMU must be assembled
and configured correctly:

1. The ADV *head* must be rigidly connected to the ADV *body*
   (pressure case, which contains the IMU sensor).

   a. For fixed-head (fixed-stem) ADVs the body is rigidly connected
      to the body.

   b. For cable-head (cabled-probe) ADVs, a support structure must be
      constructed that rigidly connects the ADV body to the head.

2. The ADV software must be configured properly.  In the 'Deployment
   Planning' frame of the Vector Nortek Software, be sure that:

   a. The IMU sensor is enabled (checkbox) and set to record *'dAng dVel Orient'*.

   b. The 'Coordinate system' must be set to *'XYZ'*.

   c. It is recommended to set the ADV velocity range to |pm| *4 m/s*,
      or larger.

3. For cable-head ADVs be sure to record the position and orientation
   of the ADV head relative to the ADV body (Figure 1). It is
   recommended that this information be stored in a
   ``<vec_filename>.userdata.json`` file (e.g., for a data file
   ``vector_data_imu01.VEC``, the userdata file should have the name
   ``vector_data_imu01.userdata.json``). `json is a simple
   text-based data format <http://www.json.org/>`_. |dlfn| expects the
   format of this file to be a single dict-like container (i.e., the
   file should start with ``{`` and end with ``}``, that contains
   ``'name': value`` pairs, for example::

    {"body2head_rotmat": [[ 0, 0, 1],
                          [ 0,-1, 0],
                          [ 1, 0, 0]],
     "body2head_vec": [0.13, 0.04, 1.3],
     "declination": 14.3,
     "lat": 43.2,
     "lon": -123,
     "depth": 90,
     "inds_range": [1000, 5000]
    }

  You can store any information you want to attribute with the binary
  `.VEC` file in this file. One advantage of creating the
  `.userdata.json` file is that this file is read when you read the
  `.VEC` file using the :func:`~dolfyn.io.nortek.read_nortek`
  function, and the name-value pairs are added to the ``props``
  attribute (a dictionary) of the returned
  :class:`~dolfyn.adv.base.ADVraw` data object.

   Figure 1) Coordinate systems of the ADV body (magenta) and head
   (yellow). The :math:`\hat{x}^\mathrm{head}` -direction is known by
   the black-band around the transducer arm, and the
   :math:`\hat{x}^*` -direction is marked by a notch on the end-cap
   (indiscernible in the image). The cyan arrow indicates the
   body-to-head vector, :math:`\vec{\ell}_{head}^*` .  The perspective
   slightly distorts the fact that :math:`\hat{x}^\mathrm{head}
   \parallel - \hat{z}^*` , :math:`\hat{y}^\mathrm{head} \parallel
   -\hat{y}^*` , and :math:`\hat{z}^\mathrm{head} \parallel
   -\hat{x}^*` .


  The other major advantage of using these ``userdata.json`` files, is
  that many property names are special in that they are used by
  |dlfn| in later processing steps. The property names that are
  recognized and used by |dlfn| to provide specific information are:

body2head_rotmat
  The rotation matrix (a 3-by-3 array) that rotates vectors in the
  ADV's pressure case coordinate system (i.e., the 'body'), to the ADV
  head coordinate system. For fixed-head ADVs this is the identify
  matrix, but for cable-head ADVs it is an arbitrary unimodular
  (determinant of 1) matrix.

body2head_vec
  The 3-element vector that specifies the position of the ADV head in
  the ADV pressure case's coordinate system (Figure 1). This property
  must be in the ``props`` attribute of the data object in order to do
  motion correction, so you might as well store it in the
  ``userdata.json`` file.

declination
  This is the magnetic declination at the measurement site. If it is
  in the ``props`` attribute, it will be incorporated into the
  orientation matrix when :func:`~dolfyn.adv.rotate.inst2earth` is
  called so that all rotations are to/from a 'True' north coordinate
  system, rather than a 'magnetic' north coordinate system.

Data processing
...............

After making ADV-IMU measurements, the |dlfn| package can perform
motion correction processing steps on the ADV data. Assuming you have
created the ``.userdata.json`` file and added the ``body2head_rotmat``
and ``body2head_vec`` attributes to it, motion correction is fairly
simple, you can either:

1. Utilize the |dlfn| api perform motion-correction processing
   explicitly in Python::

     from dolfyn.adv import api as adv

   a. Load your data file, for example::

        dat = adv.read_nortek('vector_data_imu01.vec')

   b. Then perform motion correction::

        adv.motion.correct_motion(dat, accel_filtfreq=0.1) # specify the filter frequency in Hz.


2. For users who want to perform motion correction with minimal Python
   scripting, the :repo:`motcorrect_vectory.py
   <tree/master/scripts/motcorrect_vector.py>` script can be used. So long as
   |dlfn| has been `installed properly <install>`_, you can use this
   script from the command line in a directory which contains your
   data files::

        $ python motcorrect_vector.py vector_data_imu01.vec

   By default this will write a Matlab file containing your
   motion-corrected ADV data in ENU coordinates. Note that for
   fixed-stem ADVs (no cable-head), the standard values for
   ``body2head_rotmat`` and ``body2head_vec`` can be specified by
   using the ``--fixed-head`` command-line parameter::
     
        $ python motcorrect_vector.py --fixed-head vector_data_imu01.vec

   Otherwise, these parameters should be specified in the
   ``.userdata.json`` file, as described above.

   The motcorrect_vector.py script also allows the user to specify the
   ``accel_filtfreq`` using the ``-f`` flag.  Therefore, to use a
   filter frequency of 0.1Hz (as opposed to the default 0.033Hz), you
   could do::
     
     $ python motcorrect_vector.py -f 0.1 vector_data_imu01.vec

   It is also possible to do motion correction of multiple data files
   at once, for example::

     $ python motcorrect_vector.py vector_data_imu01.vec vector_data_imu02.vec

   In all of these cases the script will perform motion correction on
   the specified file and save the data in ENU coordinates, in Matlab
   format.  Happy motion-correcting!

After following one of these paths, your data will be motion corrected and it's ``.u``,
``.v`` and ``.w`` attributes are in an East, North and Up (ENU)
coordinate system, respectively.  In fact, all vector quantities
in ``dat`` are now in this ENU coordinate system.  See the
documentation of the :func:`~dolfyn.adv.motion.correct_motion`
function for more information.

A key input parameter of motion-correction is the high-pass filter
frequency that removes low-frequency bias drift from the IMU
accelerometer signal (the default value is 0.033Hz, 30second
period). By default, |dlfn| uses a value of 0.03 Hz. For more details
on choosing the appropriate value for a particular application, please
