Metadata
========

|dlfn| generally uses the `*MKS* system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units>`_. Common variables and units are listed in Table 1:

.. csv-table:: : The units of common variables found in |dlfn| data objects.
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 15, 20, 50
               :file: ./units.csv

|dlfn| Attributes
-----------------

The ``attrs`` data-group of xarray Datasets is a place for
user-specified meta-data and |dlfn|-specific implementation data. The
most common variables found here are described in Table 2.

.. |dagger| unicode:: 0x02020 .. the dagger-symbol

.. csv-table:: The entries in ``dat.attrs`` that are used in |dlfn|.
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 15, 105
               :file: ./props_info.csv

\*: These entries are set and controlled by |dlfn|, and are not meant
to be modified directly by the user.

\*\*: These entries are set and controlled via
``dat.set_<property name>`` methods.

|dagger|: These entries are not used or set by |dlfn|, but they are
useful measurement meta-data and are listed here to assist in
standardizing the location and format of this information.
